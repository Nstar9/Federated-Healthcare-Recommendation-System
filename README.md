# 🩺 Federated Healthcare Recommender System - Heart Disease Prediction

## ✅ Project Overview
This project builds a **personalized healthcare recommender system** focused on **heart disease prediction**.  
It integrates:
- Machine Learning models
- Data preprocessing
- Visualizations
- Hyperparameter tuning

✅ **Future-ready for Federated Learning Simulation** to protect patient data privacy.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Records**: 1025 patient records
- **Features**: 13 clinical attributes (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.)
- **Target**: `1` (Heart Disease Present) or `0` (No Heart Disease)

✅ Data cleaning, one-hot encoding, scaling, and correlation analysis completed.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
| Model                 | Accuracy | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression   | 74.14%  | Baseline model                            |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | 100%    | Hyperparameter tuned (Potential Overfit)  |

✅ **Grid Search** applied to Random Forest  
✅ **Cross-validation score** for Logistic Regression: **80.59%**  
✅ Models saved as `.pkl` files for deployment

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- ✅ Correlation Heatmap
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Feature Importance Plot (Random Forest)

---

## 🌐 Deployment (In Progress)
- ✅ Streamlit App for Predictions
- ✅ API Ready (Optional **FastAPI** version for production)
- ✅ Docker-ready (Upcoming)
